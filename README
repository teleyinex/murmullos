Requirements
============

It only needs Python 2.6 and Python-clutter.

Installation 
============

The installation is pretty simple. If you have downloaded a ZIP file, uncompress it and you are ready to run it, else access
the folder murmullos after cloning the repository. Then run the command:

./murmullos.py keyword service 

Keyword can be whatever you want to search in Identi.ca or Twitter.

Service can only have two values: identica or twitter.

For example:

./murmullos.py boinc twitter


That's all. I hope you enjoy the software.
