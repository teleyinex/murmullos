See COPYRIGHT for the list of authors.

Requirements
============

It only needs Python 2.6 and Python-clutter.

Installation 
============

The installation is pretty simple. If you have downloaded a ZIP file, uncompress it and you are ready to run it, else access
the folder murmullos after cloning the repository. Just access the folder murmullos, and run the command ./murmullos.py. By 
default murmullos checks in Identi.ca for the word "gnu", if you want other, type:

./murmullos.py keyword


That's all. I hope you enjoy the software.
